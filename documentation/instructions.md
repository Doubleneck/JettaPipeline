\
\
\
When you fill your username once and password twice, check you have username length atleast 3 characters long and max 35 characters.

\
\
\
When you finally get your own user, you reach main page where you have already references or not have any. You can go to add a new reference, download a BibTex file or logout.\
\
![](./pictures/Main_page.png)\
\
\
\
If you pressed add a new reference button, you reach page where you can make a new reference. You can just add author, title, bib category, bib citekey, year and doi to text boxes. You must fill bib-category either book, article, phdthesisi or misc type and if you leave bib-citekey blank. It autogenerates you citekey so don't worry\
\
![](./pictures/New_reference.png)\
\
\
\
For example like this!\
\
![](./pictures/Reference_filled.png)\
\
\
\
If your reference is added. Software notifies about it with text 'New reference created successfully!'\
\
![](./pictures/Reference_created_successfully.png)\
\
\
\
Now main page looks like this and citekey is randomly generated as well!!!\
